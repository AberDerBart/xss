<h1>Cross Site Scripting as a feature</h1>
<p>
The goal of this website is to call attention to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a>,
a security vulnerability found far too often on websites.
</p>
<p>
It was specifically designed to be "vulnerable" to XSS in a form, that code written to the GET variable "code" is executed on loading the page (after you confirmed to trust the source).
